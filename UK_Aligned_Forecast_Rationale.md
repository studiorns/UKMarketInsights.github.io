# UK Aligned Forecast Rationale

## Overview

This document explains the rationale behind the creation of an aligned forecast for UK travel queries in 2025 that better follows the logic and growth rates of the Armenia model. After reviewing the forecast model logic in `forecast_model_logic.md`, it became clear that the original UK forecast (46.3% to 60.1% YoY) and even the conservative forecast (22.1% to 36.8% YoY) had significantly higher growth rates than the Armenia model (8.2% to 26.9% YoY).

The aligned forecast provides growth rates of 2.6% to 13.9% YoY, which are more in line with the Armenia model while still reflecting the UK market's unique characteristics.

## Parameter Adjustments

The following parameters were adjusted in the aligned forecast to better match the Armenia model's approach:

| Parameter | Armenia Model | Original UK | Conservative UK | Aligned UK | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|------------|-----------|
| Base Growth Factor | 5%, 10%, 15% | 5%, 10%, 15% | 3%, 5%, 8% | 2%, 5%, 8% | Further reduced to account for UK market maturity |
| Media Effectiveness Multiplier | 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 | 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 | 0.08, 0.12, 0.15 | 0.05, 0.08, 0.12 | Reduced to account for diminishing returns in mature market |
| Flight Search Correlation | 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 | 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 | 0.02, 0.04, 0.06 | 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 | Significantly reduced to temper impact of high flight search growth |
| Brand Health Coefficient | 0.15, 0.20, 0.25 | 0.15, 0.20, 0.25 | 0.15, 0.20, 0.25 | 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 | Reduced due to already high brand health metrics in UK |

## Justification for Adjustments

### 1. Base Growth Factor

The Armenia model uses base growth factors of 5%, 10%, and 15% for the three scenarios, but notes that these are "adjusted downward from the historical average of 120% to account for market maturation." The UK is a more mature market for Abu Dhabi tourism compared to Armenia, so the base growth factors were further reduced to 2%, 5%, and 8% to reflect this market maturity.

### 2. Media Effectiveness Multiplier

The Armenia model uses a logarithmic function to account for diminishing returns in media effectiveness:
```
Media Multiplier = 1 + (Media Effectiveness Multiplier * LOG(1 + (2025 Impressions / 2024 Impressions)))
```

The media effectiveness multipliers were reduced from the Armenia model (0.10, 0.15, 0.20) to (0.05, 0.08, 0.12) to account for potentially lower media elasticity in the more mature UK market.

### 3. Flight Search Correlation

The Armenia model notes a strong correlation (0.78) between flight searches and travel queries. However, the UK market showed exceptionally high growth in flight searches from 2023 to 2024, which if applied directly with the Armenia model's coefficients would result in unrealistically high growth forecasts. The flight search correlation parameters were significantly reduced to (0.01, 0.03, 0.05) to provide a more balanced projection.

### 4. Brand Health Coefficient

The Armenia model targets improvements in brand awareness from 36% to 40% and consideration from 19% to 25%. In contrast, the UK market already has very high brand awareness (92.70%) and consideration (33.09%), with modest targets for growth in 2025. The brand health coefficients were reduced to (0.10, 0.15, 0.20) to reflect the smaller potential impact of brand health improvements in an already strong market.

## Comparison of Results

| Scenario | Armenia Model | Original UK | Conservative UK | Aligned UK |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| Conservative | +8.2% YoY | +46.3% YoY | +22.1% YoY | +2.6% YoY |
| Moderate | +17.5% YoY | +53.2% YoY | +28.2% YoY | +8.2% YoY |
| Ambitious | +26.9% YoY | +60.1% YoY | +36.8% YoY | +13.9% YoY |

The aligned forecast now shows growth rates that are more in line with the Armenia model, while still reflecting the UK market's unique characteristics. The moderate scenario in the aligned UK forecast (+8.2% YoY) is now exactly aligned with the conservative scenario in the Armenia model (+8.2% YoY), which seems appropriate given the UK's market maturity.

## Monthly Patterns

The aligned forecast maintains the same seasonality patterns as the original forecast, with January, February, March, September, and October showing the highest growth potential. However, some months (April, May, June, July, August) now show negative or minimal growth in the conservative scenario, which is a more realistic projection given market maturity and the high base from 2024.

The most significant growth is projected for October (+17.9% to +30.9% YoY), which aligns with the seasonality index and is a key month for travel planning.

## Recommendations

Based on the aligned forecast, we recommend:

1. **Focus on High-Potential Months**: Concentrate marketing efforts on the months with positive growth potential, particularly January, February, March, September, October, and December.

2. **Manage Expectations for Summer Months**: Set realistic expectations for the summer months (June-August), which may see flat or negative growth in some scenarios due to the high base from 2024.

3. **Optimize Media Efficiency**: Given the reduced media effectiveness multipliers, focus on optimizing media spend efficiency rather than simply increasing volume.

4. **Leverage Brand Strength**: The UK market already has strong brand health metrics. Focus on converting this awareness and consideration into actual bookings rather than further brand building.

5. **Monitor Actual Performance**: Regularly track actual performance against the forecast to identify which scenario is most closely aligned with reality, and adjust strategies accordingly.

## Conclusion

The aligned forecast provides a more realistic view of the UK market's growth potential for 2025, with growth rates that are more in line with the Armenia model while still reflecting the UK's unique characteristics. By using this forecast as a reference point, stakeholders can make more informed decisions about resource allocation and strategic planning.
