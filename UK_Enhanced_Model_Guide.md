# UK Travel Queries Enhanced Forecast Model Guide

## Overview

This guide explains the enhanced forecast model for UK travel queries that incorporates statistical and machine learning approaches to improve upon the original factor-based model. The enhanced model adds three key capabilities:

1. **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies and adjusts outliers in historical data
2. **Time Series Forecasting**: Implements ARIMA models alongside the factor-based approach
3. **Bayesian Forecasting**: Incorporates uncertainty and confidence intervals in predictions

These enhancements provide a more robust forecast with statistical validation and quantified uncertainty, complementing the interpretability of the original factor-based approach.

## Enhanced Model Components

### 1. Anomaly Detection

The enhanced model uses statistical methods to identify and adjust outliers in the historical data:

- **Z-score Method**: Identifies data points that are more than 3 standard deviations from the mean
- **IQR Method**: Identifies data points that fall outside 1.5 times the interquartile range
- **Adjustment Methods**: Replaces outliers using median window, mean window, or linear interpolation

Benefits:
- Improves forecast accuracy by removing anomalous data points that could skew the model
- Provides a cleaner historical dataset for time series modeling
- Identifies potential data quality issues or exceptional events

### 2. Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA

The enhanced model implements ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling:

- **Model Selection**: Uses statistical tests to determine optimal parameters (p,d,q)
- **Differencing**: Transforms the time series to achieve stationarity
- **Forecasting**: Generates predictions based on the identified time series patterns
- **Confidence Intervals**: Provides 95% confidence intervals for the forecasts

Benefits:
- Captures temporal patterns and autocorrelations in the data
- Provides a statistical baseline forecast for comparison with the factor-based approach
- Offers a data-driven complement to the expert-driven factor model

### 3. Bayesian Forecasting

The enhanced model incorporates Bayesian methods for uncertainty quantification:

- **Probabilistic Modeling**: Models parameters as probability distributions rather than point estimates
- **Prior Knowledge**: Incorporates domain knowledge through prior distributions
- **Posterior Sampling**: Uses MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) to sample from the posterior distribution
- **Credible Intervals**: Provides 95% credible intervals that represent true probability ranges

Benefits:
- Quantifies uncertainty in a more comprehensive way
- Incorporates prior knowledge about the market
- Provides probabilistic forecasts rather than point estimates
- Allows for more informed risk assessment

## How to Use the Enhanced Model

### Prerequisites

The enhanced model requires the following Python packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- statsmodels
- scipy
- prophet (optional, for Facebook Prophet forecasting)
- pymc3 (optional, for Bayesian forecasting)

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels scipy
pip install prophet  # Optional
pip install pymc3    # Optional
```

### Running the Model

1. Navigate to the UK market directory:
   ```bash
   cd Markets/UK
   ```

2. Run the enhanced model script:
   ```bash
   python uk_forecast_enhanced_model.py
   ```

3. The script will:
   - Detect and adjust outliers in the historical data
   - Fit an ARIMA model and generate forecasts
   - Fit a Prophet model if available
   - Generate Bayesian forecasts if PyMC3 is available
   - Compare all forecasts with the factor-based model
   - Save results and plots to the UK market directory

### Output Files

The enhanced model generates the following output files:

- **uk_outliers_detection.png**: Plot showing the original time series with outliers highlighted
- **uk_outliers_detection.csv**: CSV file with outlier detection results
- **uk_forecast_comparison.png**: Plot comparing all forecast methods
- **uk_forecast_comparison.csv**: CSV file with all forecast results
- **uk_arima_forecast.csv**: ARIMA forecast results with confidence intervals
- **uk_prophet_forecast.csv**: Prophet forecast results (if available)
- **uk_bayesian_forecast.csv**: Bayesian forecast results (if available)

## Interpreting the Results

### Outlier Detection

The outlier detection plot shows the original time series with outliers highlighted in red. The adjusted time series is shown as a dashed green line. This helps identify potential data quality issues or exceptional events that might skew the forecast.

### Forecast Comparison

The forecast comparison plot shows:
- Historical data (blue line)
- Factor-based forecasts (green lines)
- ARIMA forecast with confidence intervals (red line with shaded area)
- Prophet forecast with confidence intervals (magenta line with shaded area)
- Bayesian forecast with credible intervals (cyan line with shaded area)

This allows for visual comparison of the different forecasting methods and their uncertainty ranges.

### Confidence and Credible Intervals

The confidence intervals (ARIMA, Prophet) and credible intervals (Bayesian) provide a range within which the actual values are expected to fall with 95% probability. These intervals help quantify the uncertainty in the forecasts and provide a more complete picture than point estimates alone.

## Combining with the Factor-Based Approach

The enhanced model is designed to complement, not replace, the factor-based approach. Here are some ways to combine the two:

1. **Validation**: Use the statistical models to validate the factor-based forecasts
2. **Adjustment**: Adjust the factor-based forecasts based on the statistical models
3. **Ensemble**: Create an ensemble forecast that combines both approaches
4. **Scenario Planning**: Use the confidence/credible intervals to define best-case and worst-case scenarios

## Advantages of the Enhanced Model

1. **Data-Driven**: Leverages statistical patterns in the historical data
2. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Provides confidence/credible intervals
3. **Anomaly Handling**: Identifies and adjusts for outliers
4. **Validation**: Offers statistical validation for the factor-based approach
5. **Complementary**: Combines the interpretability of the factor-based approach with the statistical rigor of time series models

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Data Requirements**: Statistical models require sufficient historical data
2. **Complexity**: More complex than the factor-based approach
3. **Black Box**: Some aspects of the statistical models may be less interpretable
4. **Assumptions**: Statistical models make assumptions about the data that may not always hold
5. **External Factors**: May not capture the impact of external factors not present in the historical data

## Conclusion

The enhanced model provides a more robust and statistically sound forecast for UK travel queries, complementing the interpretability of the original factor-based approach. By combining both approaches, you can leverage the strengths of each to make more informed decisions about resource allocation and strategic planning.
