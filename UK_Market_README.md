## Forecast Methodology

The forecast model uses the following formula:

```
2025 Predicted Queries = 2024 Queries * Base Growth Factor * Seasonality Index * Media Multiplier * Flight Search Factor * Brand Health Multiplier
```

Each of these factors is calculated based on historical data and projected growth:

1. **Base Growth Factor**: Three scenarios are considered - Conservative, Moderate, and Ambitious
2. **Seasonality Index**: Derived from 2023-2024 monthly distribution patterns
3. **Media Multiplier**: Based on planned media impressions for 2025 compared to 2024
4. **Flight Search Factor**: Based on the growth in flight searches from 2023 to 2024
5. **Brand Health Multiplier**: Based on projected growth in brand consideration

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Original Forecast | Conservative Forecast |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Conservative YoY Growth | 46.3% | 22.1% |
| Moderate YoY Growth | 53.2% | 28.2% |
| Ambitious YoY Growth | 60.1% | 36.8% |
| Peak Month | October | October |
| Highest Growth Month | May | May |

## Brand Health Metrics Definitions

- **Awareness**: Percentage of people from the UK market who are aware of Abu Dhabi
- **Consideration**: Percentage of people who consider traveling to Abu Dhabi in the next 3 years
- **Intent**: Percentage of people who consider traveling to Abu Dhabi in the next 12 months

## Recommendations

Based on the forecast analysis, the following recommendations are made for the UK market:

1. **Optimize Media Spend**: Allocate higher media budgets to the months with the highest growth potential and seasonality index, particularly January, February, March, September, and October.

2. **Leverage Flight Search Trends**: Collaborate with flight partners to capitalize on the strong growth in flight searches, particularly for the first half of the year.

3. **Focus on Brand Consideration**: While brand awareness is already high, there is room to improve brand consideration. Marketing efforts should focus on converting awareness to consideration.

4. **Seasonal Strategy**: Develop a seasonal strategy that accounts for the unique seasonality patterns of the UK market, with particular focus on the winter and early spring months.

5. **Monitor Performance**: Regularly track actual performance against the forecast to identify any deviations and adjust strategies accordingly.
