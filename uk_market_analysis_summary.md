### 3. Flight Search Impact

The months with the highest flight search growth were:

- June: 169%

- Increased impressions in Q1 to capitalize on high seasonality
- Strategic investments in September and October to maximize impact during peak query months
- Modest increases in November and December to maintain momentum

### 5. Brand Health Considerations

The UK market already has strong brand consideration (33.09%), with modest targets for growth in 2025. This results in a relatively small but positive brand health multiplier of 1.01 for Conservative and Moderate scenarios, and 1.02 for the Ambitious scenario.

Brand health metrics definitions:
- **Awareness**: Percentage of people from the UK market who are aware of Abu Dhabi
- **Consideration**: Percentage of people who consider traveling to Abu Dhabi in the next 3 years
- **Intent**: Percentage of people who consider traveling to Abu Dhabi in the next 12 months

Current brand metrics:
- Awareness: 92.70%
- Consideration: 33.09%
- Intent: 22.10%

Target brand metrics (Q4 2025):
- Awareness: 93.00% - 94.00%
- Consideration: 34.00% - 36.00%
- Intent: 23.20%

The high awareness level (92.70%) indicates that Abu Dhabi is well-known in the UK market. The consideration rate of 33.09% shows that a significant portion of those aware of Abu Dhabi are considering it as a travel destination within the next 3 years. The intent rate of 22.10% indicates that about two-thirds of those considering Abu Dhabi are planning to visit within the next 12 months, which is a strong conversion rate from consideration to intent.

## Comparison to Other Markets

The UK market forecast shows higher growth potential compared to some other markets, likely due to the combination of strong flight search growth and effective media planning. When compared to the France market:

| Moderate YoY Growth | 53.2% | 15.6% |

This significant difference highlights the UK market's strong potential for 2025.
